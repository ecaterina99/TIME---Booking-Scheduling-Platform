# TIME - Booking & Scheduling Platform
A backend-oriented platform that allows organizations (clinics, salons, service providers) to manage specialists, working schedules, and client bookings.
Organizations register themselves and configure their services, specialists, and availability. Clients can browse available services in a selected city and book time slots. The system enforces business rules such as non-overlapping bookings, service duration validation, and cancellation policies.
